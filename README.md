# Find Your Fit 🏋️‍♀️

A personalized workout plan generator powered by Generative AI.

## Process and Goal 💪

Find Your Fit was developed with the goal of providing users with instant, personalised workout plans, leveraging the power of GPT-3.5. 

The application was built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a responsive and user-friendly interface. The core of the app, the workout plan generator, was engineered using GPT-3.5. To ensure reliable and structured output, I designed a prompt that formats the generated workout plans in an easy-to-read markdown format.

Find Your Fit was a part of [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) N&W S2. I got invited to San Francisco where it progressed to the final round of pitches at [Founders Inc](https://f.inc/) (30 out of 130 total participants).

One of the key features of the application is the implementation of output streaming, which offers an instant response and significantly improves the user experience.
